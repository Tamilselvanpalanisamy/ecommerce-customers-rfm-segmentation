📊 E-commerce Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

📌 Project Overview

    This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis on an e-commerce dataset.
The goal is to identify different customer groups based on their purchasing behavior and help businesses make data-driven marketing and retention decisions.

🎯 Problem Statement

E-commerce businesses often struggle to:

    -Identify high-value customers

    -Retain loyal customers

    -Detect at-risk or inactive customers

Using RFM analysis, customers can be segmented into meaningful groups to support targeted marketing strategies and customer retention efforts.

🧠 What is RFM Analysis?

    -Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase

    -Frequency (F): How often a customer makes purchases

    -Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends

Customers are scored and grouped based on these metrics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

    -Python

    -Pandas

    -NumPy

    -VS Code

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains e-commerce transaction details such as:

    -Invoice number

    -Customer ID

    -Quantity

    -Invoice date

    -Unit price

Data cleaning was performed to handle missing and invalid values.

📐 RFM Calculation

    -Recency: Days since last purchase from a reference date

    -Frequency: Number of unique invoices per customer

    -Monetary: Total spending per customer

R, F, and M values were scored using quantiles (1–5 scale).

🧩 Customer Segmentation

Customers were grouped into segments such as:

    -Champions

    -Loyal Customers

    -Potential Loyalists

    -At Risk

    -Lost Customers

Each segment represents a different customer behavior pattern.

📊 Final Output

The final output is a customer-level RFM table containing:

    -Recency

    -Frequency

    -Monetary

    -RFM Scores

    -Customer Segment

This table can be further used for visualization or business decision-making.

🚀 Business Value

    -Identifies high-value customers

    -Helps design targeted marketing campaigns

    -Improves customer retention strategies

    -Supports data-driven decision making

📌 Future Enhancements

    -Visualize RFM segments using Power BI

    -Build an interactive dashboard

    -Apply clustering algorithms for advanced segmentation
